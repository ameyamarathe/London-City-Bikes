# London City Bikes


The project focuses on analyzing the weather conditions in London City and its impact on bike usage. The dataset used originates from TFL (Transport for London) and includes additional weather metadata from Freemateo.com. The analysis allows users to customize their queries based on specific days, weeks, months, or years.

The data retrieval process involves accessing the Kaggle website using the Kaggle API. The Pandas library is utilized for data manipulation and cleaning, ensuring removal of errors and duplicates. Seasonal and weather condition classifications are created through the creation of new data dictionaries. Furthermore, column names are standardized for improved clarity and consistency.

The final processed data is saved in .xls format and imported into Tableau, a data visualization tool. This enables the creation of insightful visual representations of the data, facilitating a better understanding of the relationship between weather conditions and bike usage in London City.
